# Brain Tumor Detection Using Color Segmentation With KMeans Clustering

Color-based segmentation algorithm with K-means is used to convert a given gray-level MR image into a color space image and then separate the position of tumor objects from other items of an MR image by using K-means clustering and histogram-clustering.
